                “Complicated” is the first single from Avril’s debut album Let Go, and<br> 
                by extension her entire music career. It’s about the problems that arise <br>
                when you pretend to be something you’re not and you just need to chill, relax, and enjoy life.<br><br>

                weeks in a row and reached the #2 spot on the Hot 100. The song <br>
                went on to sell over 3 million copies worldwide.

                [Intro]<br><br>
                Uh-huh, life's like this<br>
                Uh-huh, uh-huh<br>
                That's the way it is<br>
                'Cause life's like this<br>
                Uh-huh, uh-huh<br>
                That's the way it is<br><br>
                
                [Verse 1]<br><br>
                Chill out, whatcha yellin' for?<br>
                Lay back, it's all been done before<br>
                And if you could only<br>
                Let it be, you would see<br>
                I like you the way you are<br>
                When we're drivin' in your car<br>
                And you're talkin' to me<br>
                One-on-one but you become<br><br>
                
                [Pre-Chorus]<br><br>
                Somebody else 'round everyone else<br>
                You're watchin' your back like you can't relax<br>
                You're tryna be cool, you look like a fool to me, tell me<br><br>
                
                [Chorus]<br><br>
                Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?<br>
                I see the way you're<br>
                Actin' like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated<br>
                Life's like this, you<br>
                And you fall, and you crawl, and you break<br>
                And you take what you get and you turn it into<br>
                Honesty and promise me, I'm never gonna find you fake it<br>
                No, no, no<br><br>
                
                [Verse 2]<br><br>
                You come over unannounced<br>
                Dressed up like you're somethin' else<br>
                Where you are and where it's at<br>
                You see, you're makin' me<br>
                Laugh out when you strike your pose<br>
                Take off all your preppy clothes<br>
                You know, you're not foolin'<br>
                Anyone when you become<br><br>
                
                [Pre-Chorus]<br><br>
                Somebody else 'round everyone else<br>
                You're watchin' your back like you can't relax<br>
                You're tryna be cool, you look like a fool to me, tell me<br><br>
                
                [Chorus]<br><br>
